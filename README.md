# Data-Analysis-Extended-case1

Business Problem. As part of one of your projects, you have been asked to perform an
exploratory data analysis of historical data to detect patterns in the provenance, physical
profile, and other characteristics of the athletes who compete in the Olympic games.
The conclusions of your analysis will help the rest of the team prepare a report for a new
client who helps sports gear manufacturers find advertising opportunities.

all the Olympic games from Norway 1994 to Rio 2016. It comprises data for 46,533
individual athletes and has 13 columns for each one of them. There are 68,848 rows instead

multiple medals
